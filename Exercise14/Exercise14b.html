      <p class="Burger">The hamburger, also called burger, ground beef. The term is applied variously to a patty of ground beef, sometimes called Hamburg steak, Salisbury steak, or Vienna steak, a sandwich consisting of a patty of ground beef served within a split bread roll, with various garnishes, or the ground beef itself, which is used as a base in many sauces, casseroles, terrines, and the like. Hamburgers are customarily eaten as a sandwich, between two halves of a round bun. Mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, and other condiments, along with garnishes of lettuce, onion, tomato, and sliced cucumber pickle, constitute the customary dressing. In the variation known as the cheeseburger, a slice of cheese is melted over the patty. The patty itself is often seasoned or augmented with chopped onions, spices, or bread crumbs before cooking.</p>

      <p class="TheUniqueandItsProperty">The Unique and Its Property brings to the world a radical view: egoism, the notion that the individual is the measure of all things. Max Stirner's opus first published in 1845. In the first new English-language translation since 1907, egoist anarchist author and historian Wolfi Landstreicher has brought forward both the form and the intent of Stirner's work. This edition delivers every "occasional crudity" and all the "playful ferocity" that the German original possesses.</p>

      <p class="Lo-Fi">Lo-fi, or lofi, refers to a recording with less than professional or flawed sound quality. “Lo-fi” is short for “low fidelity,” and initially referred to a low-quality recording with audible imperfections, such as background noise or performance mistakes, recorded with inexpensive equipment—the opposite of high fidelity or hi-fi production. In the 1980s and 1990s, lo-fi was regarded as a more authentic-sounding form of music production than professional methods. Many punk, indie rock, and hip-hop artists pursued a lo-fi aesthetic for economic and artistic reasons. Lo-fi represents a subgenre of electronic music that shares qualities with downtempo music, the chillwave scene, and lo-fi hip-hop. Lo-fi music mixed elements of house, jazz, easy listening, and hip-hop beats and samples with a DIY music aesthetic that emphasized the imperfect, homemade quality of analog recordings. The result was dreamy audio with a relaxed, retro sound that many found ideal for background music, especially studying.</p>
